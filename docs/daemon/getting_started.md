# Getting Started
::: tip Information

The Daemon is going to be run on the servers you want to monitor, this will allow the core to get more information about the health of the device.

You do not need this running because the core just quickly ssh's and a few other things to ensure the server is working.

NOTE: What it is written above doesn't mean it is going to be working that way. It could change at any moment during the development process
