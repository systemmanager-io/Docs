::: tip
Although it is not necessary to run a seperate worker it is highly recommended if you plan on monitoring a lot of servers (NOT CONFIRMED YET)
:::

## Requirements
- Git
- NodeJS 12
- NPM
- ArangoDB (MySQL Support is coming.)
- Linux based OS. (List of verified OSes coming soon)

## Installing SystemManager

- NOTES: There must be a way to have an installer on first run. We could use Inquirer for this to create such an first run menu
